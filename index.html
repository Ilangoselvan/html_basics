			<h1>Oil Rises on Russian Export Cuts, Offsets Virus Demand Jitters</h1>
			
			 
			<p>Oil prices rose after Russia slashed exports of its flagship crude Urals to the lowest in at least 10 years, signaling the determination of Moscow to work with its partners at OPEC+ to eliminate an oil glut.

				Futures in New York gained 1.9% Thursday. Still, with the virus driving recovery prospects, a dose of pessimism has returned to the oil market. In Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. oil industry, the governor warned that a “massive outbreak” is sweeping the state. New infections also reached daily records in Florida and California, with the fear of new lockdowns sending U.S. gasoline futures tumbling by the most in two months Wednesday.

			<p>Time is the most vital thing in someone’s life. <b>It is like a running river that flows and never looks back.</b> Time is unidirectional; it moves in the forward direction and never in the backward direction. There is a <i>perfect time for everything, nothing can happen before the perfect time has come</>. You might make various plans, but they will only happen when the perfect time comes. <mark>It is essential to understand the value of time, which is extremely hard.</mark> You will have to go through great losses if you do not value time and understand the value of time. Loss of time is the worst thing that can ever happen. People think that money is a precious thing, but time is even more precious and priceless. You might be rich, but you can never buy time. Every minute is a huge warehouse of new opportunities in life. Therefore, we should never waste such valuable time and make the most use of it. One can kneel in front of time, but one can never vanquish it. We are unable to measure its potential because success can occur in a single moment or over the course of a lifetime. One can be the wealthiest person on the planet at one moment and then be the poorest person on the planet the next moment. One second is all it takes to make the difference between life and death. Every instance provides us with a plethora of chances; all we have to do is wisely make use of the time available to us.
